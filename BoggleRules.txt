The game begins by shaking a covered tray of 16 cubic dice, each with a different letter printed on each of its sides. 

The dice settle into a 4×4 tray so that only the top letter of each cube is visible. After they have settled into the grid, 

a three-minute sand timer is started and all players simultaneously begin the main phase of play.[3]

Each player searches for words that can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjacent cubes, where "adjacent" cubes are those horizontally, vertically, and diagonally neighboring. 

Words must be at least three letters long, may include singular and plural (or other derived forms) separately, but may not use the same letter cube more than once per word. 

Each player records all the words he or she finds by writing on a private sheet of paper.

In the scoring phase, each player reads off his or her list of discovered words. 

If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players' lists. 

Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case a previously nominated dictionary is used to verify or refute it. 

For all words remaining after duplicates have been eliminated, points are awarded based on the length of the word.

 The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties typically broken by count of long words.
