Words must be at least three letters long, may include singular and plural (or other derived forms) separately, but may not use the same letter cube more than once per word. 

Each player records all the words he or she finds by writing on a private sheet of paper. 

(3 letter word =	1)
(4 letter word =	1)
(5 letter word =	2)
(6 letter word =	3)
(7 letter word=	4)
(8+ letter word =	11)

In the scoring phase, each player reads off his or her list of discovered words. 

If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players' lists. 

Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case a previously nominated dictionary is used to verify or refute it. 

For all words remaining after duplicates have been eliminated, points are awarded based on the length of the word.

 The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties typically broken by count of long words.
